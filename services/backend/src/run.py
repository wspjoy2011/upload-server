This script watches for changes in Python files and automatically
restarts the server when changes are detected, enabling faster
development without manual restarts.

Usage:
    python run.py

Side effects:
    - Launches a server process.
    - Monitors Python files for changes.
    - Restarts the server process when changes are detected.
    - Logs server status and error conditions.
