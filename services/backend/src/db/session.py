"""Database connection management module.

This module provides functionality for creating and managing a connection pool
to the database. It implements a singleton pattern for the connection pool
to ensure efficient reuse of database connections across the application.

The module supports both direct PostgreSQL connections and connections via
PgBouncer, based on the application configuration.

Side effects:
    - Creates a connection pool on first access.
    - Maintains open database connections in the pool.
